# upturne
Upturne saves rebar and concrete consumption by redesigning metal structures and industrial sheds. This reduction of materials is done without changing the architectural plan of the project.

Aboat us
Upterne (building optimizer super engine), by relying on artificial intelligence technology and genetic algorithm, designs the structure in the most optimal way from the economic point of view. This optimization without reducing the stability and structural strength of the building and industrial structures with the help of Artificial intelligence is done.
With the help and support of prominent professors of the country's universities and in connection with knowledge bases and structural and earthquake engineers, Upturne Group succeeded in designing an algorithm for the design of the structure that can pay less without reducing the structural resistance against earthquakes.
The working method of this complex is exactly similar to the valid regulations of the client's country and with the assurance of the structure's resistance against earthquakes. This algorithm meets all the structural design requirements of the recognized international code.
For the optimal design of a structure, the best result should be achieved by spending a lot of time and designing different models of the structure, which requires spending a lot of time and energy, which is not possible under normal conditions.
Using artificial intelligence, the Upturne series has carried out repeated designs of a structure with different modeling and repeated calculations of the structure, which enables us to optimize the design in the shortest time and with the least energy.

WHY UPTERNE
Various parameters are involved in the design of a building. A designer can design it according to his experience and specialized knowledge, but how close is the completed design to the optimal design?
The answer to this question lies in time and redesigns. In other words, the designer must design the structure more times by spending more time to achieve the optimal design.




 

Due to the need for a lot of time, this process is beyond the scope of engineers and even the employer, so respected designers do not use this process and limit themselves to the primary and secondary design.
 

This process in the Upturne collection is not done with one design but with several thousands of designs and in the end it achieves the best result.
Our team integrates artificial intelligence with experience and expertise and achieves the best design result. You can see the performance of the optimization engine in the above diagram. The construction project is concrete and has 12 floors. In this project, the optimization engine cost of Optern set reduced the cost of construction by 22.4% with 53 thousand design times with the help of artificial intelligence and optimization algorithms. This cost reduction in the structure has been created without changing the architecture of the structure and without changing the client's wishes and without reducing the structural strength, and it was done by repeating the calculations with the help of artificial intelligence.

Another example in the 6-story concrete construction project with a shear wall was optimized by the Aptern team, and 16% cost savings were achieved with artificial intelligence 51,000 design times.
 It should be noted that the cost savings made in the above two projects are only in the structure, this reduction in the weight of the structure leads to a reduction in foundation costs, which does not include the mentioned cost reduction.
dvantages of using Upturne
1. Lightening the building (reducing the weight of rebar and concrete)
2. Reduction of molding costs (in Upturne, it is possible to calculate reinforcement costs and molding costs in different designs)
3. Reducing steel and concrete costs and making construction more economical
4. Protecting the environment in order to save on consumables
5. Improving the performance of the structure (better behavior of the structure against earthquakes)
6. Reducing the twisting and irregularity of the building
7. Reducing the dimensions of the sections and increasing the usable area of the building

Upturne service
Counseling
In order to get advice from the experts of Uptern Group, you can contact the consultants of the Engineers Group for free in the e-mail section. In this section, the consultants will guide you to design or optimize the desired structure.


Optimization
In this part, Upturne optimizes the client's project by concluding a contract with the condition of providing the minimum percentage of structural optimization announced by Upturne experts in the consultation section. The tariff of this section is determined as a percentage of the amount of costs saved in the building structure section.
Designing
In this part, the Upturne group designs the desired structure of the client anew. The tariff for this part is determined by the engineering system.
